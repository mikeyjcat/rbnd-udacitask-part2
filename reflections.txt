# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
    About four hours
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
    Trying to do it cleanly
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
    Formatted printing and sorting
    Manually formatting fields to specific lengths seems like a waste of time
    Item lists like this should be sorted by date
    Using the formatting gem enabled me to reduce the amount of code significantl,
    with the formatting work offloaded onto the gem
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
    Just feels like I need to practice to groove in the syntax, and constructs used
    so theres less stackoverflow
