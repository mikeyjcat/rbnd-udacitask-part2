    About four hours
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
    Trying to do it cleanly
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
    Formatted printing and sorting
    Manually formatting fields to specific lengths seems like a waste of time

    The code in UdaciList does not feel right yet
